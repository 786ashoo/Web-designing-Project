ESTABLISHMENT OF SHUHADA MOAVIN CELL AT<br />
 AIR HEADQUARTERS, ISLAMABAD</h1><br />
 	 
<h3>PAF prides itself as an organization with deep rooted principles and
 enduring values with special emphasis on respecting the dignity and welfare
 of its retired personnel and families of PAF Shuhada.
  The Shuhada’s families and retired community are a valuable part of the Air Force Family.
  However, it has been observed that due to lack of know how regarding service procedures, 
  this community often faces problems in availing the facilities authorized to them at many occasions.	<br /> <br />
 	 
In this regard, a dedicated “Shuhada Moavin Cell” has been established at Air Headquarters Islamabad. The purpose of the cell is to provide “One Window Facilitation” which would assist the families of Shuhada as well as Retired Officers, Airmen and Civilians. The cell will act as hub for effective coordination with different PAF agencies, especially in case of sudden emergencies like death or such distress situations requiring immediate assistance.<br /><br />

Staff of the Cell will be available on telephone round the clock on the following numbers:- <br />	<br /><br /> 
 	Contact :	 	051-9505146 (During working hours only)<br />
 	 	0323-9402333 (Round the clock)<br />
 	 	 
E-mail Address :	 	shuhadamoavincell@gmail.com<br />

 	 	 
Postal Address :	 	Shuhada Moavin Cell, AHQ<br />
